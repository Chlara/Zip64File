                <h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
                
                <p><em>Zip64File</em> was developed as part of the SIARD project. 
                  It is used by the <em>SiardApi</em> implementation of the SIARD project in 
                  order to read and write SIARD files adhering to the standardized 
                  SIARD Format 2.1.</p>

                </p>

                <h3>ZIP64</h3>
                <p>The ZIP format was created by created in 1989 by Phil Katz 
                  for <a href="https://pkware.com/" target="_blank">PKZIP</a>. 
                  It is widely used for compression and as a container of 
                  files and folders (e.g. Windows ZIP folders, JAVA JAR 
                  files, OpenOffice ODT files, Microsoft Office DOCX files, ...).</p>
                <p>The liberal treatment of the ZIP format by its creator 
                  has motivated many programmers to develop tools on many 
                  platforms which can read and write ZIP files.</p>
                <p>Lately the limitations of the „old“ ZIP file format 
                  specification (maximum file size 4GB, maximum number of 
                  files 65k) were felt to be too constrictive for today's 
                  needs. Therefore PKWARE published a <a href="https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT" target="_blank">new version of the 
                  file format description</a> which permits 64 bit file sizes 
                  and 32 bit file counts.</p>
                <p>At this point in time most of the third-party utilities 
                  and libraries do not support this extension to 64 bits yet. 
                  Therefore we have developed a JAVA library as well as a 
                  command-line utility which permits reading and writing 
                  of files according to the new ZIP64 standard.</p>
                <p>Both, the library and the command-line utility implement 
                  a subset of the ZIP64 standard. At the moment neither 
                  splitting and spanning nor encryption are supported. 
                  Both, the library and the utility can read files 
                  according to the ZIP32 or ZIP64 standard, but they will 
                  only write files according to the ZIP64 standard – even 
                  when the content could be accommodated within the 
                  limitations of the ZIP32 standard.</p>
                <p>The use of the API in <em>zip64.jar</em> is documented 
                  in its technical documentation. The usage of the command-line
                  tool is documented in this manual.</p>

                <h3>Addendum 2011/2018</h3>
                <p>In JAVA 1.7 the built-in JAVA ZIP utilities (<em>java.util.zip</em>) 
                finally do support ZIP contents larger than 4 GB. However, 
                they do not permit manipulating large ZIP files in a convenient 
                way (random access file). This has the advantage that the 
                classes in <em>java.util.zip</em> can be applied to streams. 
                But it has the disadvantage that a small update may force 
                the writing of many gigabytes. Therefore this library is 
                still supported as an alternative to it.</p>
                
                <p><em>Zip64File</em> can be used for 
                  many other purposes without any relationship with the
                  SIARD project. Therefore it is published as a separate
                  stand-alone project.</p>
