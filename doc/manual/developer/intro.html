                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The original code of the ZIP64 libraries was developed 
                  in 2007 as part of the <a href="https://www.bar.admin.ch/bar/de/home/archivierung/tools---hilfsmittel/siard-suite.html" target="_blank">SIARD Suite</a> 
                  of the Swiss Federal Archives. For archiving large 
                  databases a standardized platform-independent container 
                  format was needed that could accommodate files larger 
                  than 4GB and many more files than the 65'536 that could 
                  be accommodated by the traditional tools.</p>
                <p>Similar to the approach chosen by the developers of 
                  OpenOffice and Microsoft Office, the Swiss Federal Archives 
                  decided on a ZIP file containing XML files holding 
                  metadata describing the database structure, XML files 
                  with the primary table data, and binary files for the database 
                  LOBS (large objects) as their basic format for long-term 
                  preservation of relational databases.</p>
                <p>Our investigation showed, that every implementation of 
                  ZIP (including Windows zipped folders and <em>java.util.zip</em>)
                  with the exception of <em>PkWare</em>, the inventor and 
                  leader of the field, only implemented the version 2.x 
                  of the format, which since more than ten years has been 
                  enhanced by <em>PkWare</em> to accommodate large files. 
                  We call this enhanced format (ZIP file specification 
                  4.5 or higher) ZIP64 for short, because it uses 64 bit 
                  long integers for file sizes and such, distinguishing 
                  it from the old ZIP32 format supported by everybody else.</p>

                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>The following requirements guided the development:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>SIARD files would become very large. The user „opening“ 
                    such a Tera-byte file should not experience long waiting times.</li>
                  <li>The ZIP64 format implemented would not have to support 
                    all features of the <a href="https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT" target="_blank">current ZIP file standard</a>. 
                    It did not need to support splitting, spanning or 
                    encryption. It did not need to support exotic mainframe 
                    file systems, support of Windows and LINUX/UNIX platforms 
                    would be sufficient. It did not need to support many 
                    different compression methods as it would mainly be 
                    used as a container. (Compression being an issue that 
                    should be delegated to the device drivers of the storage 
                    media rather than handled at application level.) It 
                    should, however, within its limitations be interoperable 
                    with <em>PKZIP</em> from <em>PkWare</em>, the only 
                    other software supporting the ZIP64 format.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The first of these requirements was met by relying on 
                  random access files. As opposed to most other basic JAVA 
                  file I/O utilities including <em>java.util.zip</em> the 
                  <em>Zip64File</em> library is not based on streams but 
                  on the JAVA class <em>RandomAccessFile</em> – a reason 
                  to call it <em>Zip64File</em> rather than just <em>Zip64</em>.
                  In the SIARD application we would have to write this file 
                  once. But every later access would only open the ZIP 
                  directory located at the very end of the file and the 
                  XML file containing the metadata. By making sure that 
                  every freshly written file was written at the very end 
                  just before the central ZIP directory, reading and writing 
                  of metadata would be fast. Read-access to any data that the 
                  user desired, would be fast too, because a random access 
                  seek would access them in seconds, even in very large files.</p>
                <p>The second requirement was met by sticking meticulously 
                  to the ZIP64 file format description of <em>PkWare</em> 
                  and by continually testing the interoperability with <em>PKZIP</em>.</p>
                <h3>Public Domain Development</h3>
                <p>For a while <em>Zip64File</em> was offered as downloadable 
                  source on <a href="https://www.enterag.ch" target="_blank">Enter AG's web site</a>.
                  Then it was found that many users of <em>SIARD Suite</em>
                  had a need for a public domain utility helping them to 
                  UNZIP their SIARD files for inspection. Their objection 
                  to using <em>PKZIP</em> was less due to tight-fistedness 
                  or a lack of recognition for the merits of <em>PkWare</em> in 
                  the development of the ZIP format but a fear of lock-in 
                  if they were dependent on a single supplier.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the command-line utility <em>zip64</em> was 
                  developed which permits to ZIP and UNZIP files in the ZIP64 
                  format – subjected to the restrictions mentioned above: 
                  No spanning or splitting, no encryption, no proprietary, 
                  fancy compression formats.</p>
                <p>In the process of this development the code of both the 
                  library and API Zip64File as well as for the command-line 
                  utility zip64 was moved to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/zip64file/" target="_blank">SourceForge</a>.
                  When the Swiss Federal Archives decided to publish the
                  source code of <em>SIARD Suite 2.1</em> on <em>GitHub</em>,
                  the project <em>Zip64File</em> was slightly refactored
                  and moved there too.</p> 
                
                <p>This document is the developers' manual of the project <em>Zip64File</em>.</p>

                </p>

                <h3>Addendum 2011/2018</h3>
                <p>In JAVA 1.7 the built-in JAVA ZIP utilities (<em>java.util.zip</em>) 
                finally do support ZIP contents larger than 4 GB. However, 
                they do not permit manipulating large ZIP files in a convenient 
                way (random access file). This has the advantage that the 
                classes in <em>java.util.zip</em> can be applied to streams. 
                But it has the disadvantage that a small update may force 
                the writing of many gigabytes. Therefore this library is 
                still supported as an alternative to it.</p>
